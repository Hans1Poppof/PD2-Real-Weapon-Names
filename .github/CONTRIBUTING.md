# Real Weapon Names Contribution Guidelines

:tada: **Thanks for taking the time and effort to make Real Weapon Names better!**

## Crash, Error, Issue reporting/Feature requests

* Take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/Strappazzon/PD2-Real-Weapon-Names/issues) first to make sure your issue/feature hasn't been reported/requested before. If so, engage in the already existing discussion.
* Check whether your issue/feature is already fixed/implemented.
* Check if the issue still exists in the latest release.
* Issues in languages other than English will be closed and ignored.
* If you are a Lua developer, you are always welcome to fix/implement an issue/feature yourself. PRs are welcome!
* Add one issue at a time. Do not put multiple issues into one thread.
* When reporting a bug please describe the steps which reproduce the problem.
* All issues must be properly formatted with Markdown. If you don't know what that is, read [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) before submitting an issue.

### DO NOT post "+1" comments

**DO NOT post "+1", "me too", or similar comments - they just add noise to an issue.**

If you don't have any additional info/context to add but would like to indicate that you're affected by the issue, upvote the original issue by clicking its [+:smiley:] button and hitting :thumbsup: (+1) icon.

## Code Contribution

* Make changes on a separate branch, not on the master branch, then send your changes as a pull request.
* When submitting changes, you confirm that your code is licensed under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
* Please test your code before you submit changes. Untested code will **not** be merged!
* Make sure your PR is up-to-date with the rest of the code.
